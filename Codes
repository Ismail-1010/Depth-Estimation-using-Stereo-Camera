ðŸ“˜ Stereo_Calibration.py
Purpose:

  -- This script performs stereo camera calibration using image pairs to compute depth-related parameters like focal length and angle of convergence (Î¸). These calibrated values are critical for accurate disparity calculation and 3D depth estimation in our stereo vision system.

Highlights:

-- Uses object detection and segmentation with Mask R-CNN to localize targets in both images.

-- Computes horizontal disparities between bounding boxes.

-- Derives focal length and geometric configuration from known object distances.

-- Outputs key calibration parameters: focal length (f) and tan(Î¸).

ðŸ“˜ Depth_Estimation.py

Purpose:
-- This is the main inference script that connects to two ESP32-CAM modules, captures live stereo video streams, and performs real-time depth estimation and object detection.

Highlights:

-- Streams video from ESP32-CAMs via IP.

-- Performs Mask R-CNNâ€“based detection on both left and right frames.

-- Calculates disparity and applies calibrated geometry to estimate object distances.

-- Annotates each object with its category and real-time distance in centimeters.

-- Interactive controls to adjust resolution, quality, and white balance dynamically.
