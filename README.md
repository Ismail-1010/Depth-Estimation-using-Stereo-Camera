# 📌 Depth Estimation using Stereo Camera (ESP32-CAM)
This project demonstrates a cost-effective depth estimation system using a stereo vision setup built with two ESP32-CAM modules. Developed during my internship at SPARK MINDA Centre of Excellence in Automotive Electronics, REVA University, the system captures synchronized stereo images and computes depth maps using OpenCV.

🎯 Project Objectives
  -- Build a stereo camera system for real-time depth estimation.

  -- Use low-cost ESP32-CAM modules for live video transmission.

  -- Implement stereo image calibration,  disparity mapping, and object detection.

  -- Develop a scalable and affordable alternative to expensive depth cameras like Intel RealSense or OAK-D.
